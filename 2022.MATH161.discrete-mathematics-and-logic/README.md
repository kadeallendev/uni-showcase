# MATH161 Discrete Mathematics and Logic

This course introduces the basic notions of logic and discusses what makes some arguments good (or valid), while other arguments are invalid. This leads to a definition of a mathematical proof. Particular attention is paid to mathematical induction. Other topics include sets, relations, functions, elementary counting principles, and an introduction to number theory. The second half of the course introduces the fundamental concepts of graph theory, which is the study of networks.

## Course Learning Objectives

1. Know the important definitions and results in introductory discrete mathematics, and understand their significance.
2. Demonstrate your understanding by stating definitions and results, and solving simple problems.
3. Demonstrate an ability to create mathematical arguments and communicate them.
