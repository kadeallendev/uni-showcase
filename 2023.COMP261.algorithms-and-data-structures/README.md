# COMP261 Algorithms and Data Structures

This course covers a range of algorithms and data structures. The major areas covered are: graph algorithms, graphics algorithms and advanced data structures. This course takes a practical approach focusing on the implementation of a wide variety of algorithms.

## Course Learning Objectives

1. Select, adapt, and implement a wide range of standard algorithms and data structures to construct software solutions to complex problems.
2. Understand algorithms described in pseudocode and to use analysis of an algorithm's time and space requirements to determine applicability to a problem.
3. Recognise the distinction between "easy" problems, 'hard' (NP) problems, and uncomputable problems and the consequences for constructing algorithms and programs for such problems.
4. Know and be able to implement important algorithms related to graphs, searching, and parsing.
