# NWEN241 A2: Simple Database in C

This assignment involved implementing a simple in-memory database in C. We used a C struct to represent an album with an id, title, year and artist field. This was then stored in a dynamically allocated array.

We had to implement methods to perform the following:
- Display a given row
- Create and add a row to the database (dynamically allocating a new array if over capacity)
- Remove a row from the database (reallocating if possible)
