# NWEN241 A3: Socket Programming in C

This assignment involved creating a simple file server using sockets in C. The program would connect to a client, then respond according to the received message.

- If 'BYE' was received, the server would close the connection to the client, and wait for new connections.
- If 'GET' followed by a filename was received, the server would read the contents of the file, and send back the contents of the file.

The program used response headers and status codes to represent the state of the request.
