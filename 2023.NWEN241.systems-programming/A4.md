# NWEN241 A4: Database in C++

This assignment involved creating a simple in-memory database in C++, similar to that of [Assignment 2](./A2.md). The database would store records of movie structs containing an id, title, year, and director. We used an object-oriented design, utilising abstract classes and virtual methods. The program was able to load and save from CSV files.

We had to implement methods to perform the following:
- Get the number of rows in the database
- Get a given row from the database
- Add a row to the database
- Update a row in the database
- Remove a row from the database
- Load a database from a CSV file
- Save the database to a CSV file
