# SWEN304: Database System Engineering

The course addresses fundamental principles underlying databases and database management systems. It covers the structure and principles of the relational data model, including SQL, and the principled design of the relational database schema. It also addresses issues in database transaction procession, concurrency control, recovery, and the complexity of query processing.

## Course learning objectives

Students who pass this course will be able to:

1. Demonstrate understanding of the principles of database systems generally and the relational database model specifically.
2. Set up, query, and update a relational database using interactive SQL.
3. Set up, query, and update a relational database using a transaction program written in Java.
4. Explain the basic principles and common trade-offs in designing a relational database, and to design it.
5. Explain the basic principles and common trade-offs in relational database query optimization.
6. Explain the basic principles of database concurrency control and recovery, and implement them within a transaction program.
