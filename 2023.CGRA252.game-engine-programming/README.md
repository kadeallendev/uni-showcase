# CGRA252 Game Engine Programming

This course introduces students to game engines and teaches them how to use the variety of tools in these engines to build games and graphics output. Students will gain a deeper understanding of the graphics pipeline in relation to game engines. I used the Godot game engine to build various games.

## Course Learning Objectives

1. Use standard conceptual frameworks and vocabulary for computer game engines, their components, and designs.
2. Identify key qualities and features of different game engine systems, in order to evaluate them and use them effectively.
3. Extend various engine systems and combine them to engage in game development.
4. Describe and modify the graphics pipeline within a game/graphics engine to demonstrate understanding of core algorithms in computer graphics.
5. Work in teams to build technical demonstrations of game/graphics engine features and extensions.
