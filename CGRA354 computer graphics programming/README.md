# CGRA354: Computer Graphics Programming

This course addresses algorithms, mathematical knowledge and programming tools for 3D computer graphics, including offline rendering. It covers programming with modern low-level graphics APIs, shader programming and the graphics processing pipeline (including geometry processing, viewing, projection, transformation, illumination, texture mapping and shading algorithms).

## Course learning objectives

Students who pass this course should be able to:

1. Implement computer graphics applications when given an appropriate basic framework from which to start, and be able to load, view, shade, and manipulate polygon meshes.
2. Explain and implement three-dimensional rigid object animation using physical simulation.
3. Demonstrate an ability to use a range of algebraic tools, including trilinear and tricubic interpolation, vector arithmetic (dot and cross products), intersection calculations between a ray and various primitive objects, velocity and position updates in interactive physical simulation.
4. Explore and implement global illumination algorithms (such as ray tracing) for photorealistic lighting/appearance simulation.
