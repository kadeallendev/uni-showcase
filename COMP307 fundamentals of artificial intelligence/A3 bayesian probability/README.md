# COMP307 A3: Bayesian Probability

This assignment involved two parts.

## Part 1: Naive Bayes Classifier

This part involved implementing a naive Bayesian classifier. Given a dataset regarding breast cancer, the program could classify instances as either 'no-recurrence-events' or 'recurrence-events'.
A naive Bayesian classifier uses Bayes' theorem to calculate the probabilities for an instance based off a dataset.

## Part 2: Bayesian Network

This part involved creating a Bayesian Network, given some probabilities related to a lecturer's work patterns and presence in her office. An example question would be: "If we know that Eve is in her office, what is the probability that she is logged on, but her light is off."
A Bayesian network uses a directed graph to represent how different variables are related, and uses these relationships to calculate the likelihood of other events.
