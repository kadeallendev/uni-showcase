# CGRA151 Introduction to Computer Graphics and Games

This course introduces necessary background, fundamental concepts, and basic algorithms of Computer Graphics, including human visual perception, representation of colour and images, representation of 2D and 3D spaces, manipulation, movement and drawing of 2D and 3D objects. The Processing programming language and tools will be used to investigate many of the ideas.

## Course Learning Objectives

1. Write simple programs for graphics and games in the Processing programming language.
2. Understand, explain and reproduce a range of fundamental computer graphics and game algorithms, including line drawing, polygon filling, z-buffer, collision detection and movement.
3. Understand and use the vector and matrix representations in homogenous co-ordinate systems, to perform geometric transformations in two and three dimensions Understand and describe 3D viewing and perspective projection.
4. Understand and explain human interaction with computer systems via performance modelling. Describe the limitations, and the implications these limitations have on representation and interactions with computer graphics and games.
5. Explain fundamental properties of light, colour, the human visual system, and basic mechanics, particularly as they relate to the creation of programs for graphics and games.
