# COMP307 A2: Neural Network and Probability

This assignment consisted of three parts.

## Part 1: Reasoning under uncertainty

This part involved some probability calculations.

## Part 1: Perceptron

The first part involved implementing a simple, single-layer perceptron. The perceptron would be trained on a data set of radar samples, and would classify instances into two classes.
A perceptron works by taking a list of inputs, multiplying them by the perceptron's weights, adding the bias node's value, and then passing the output through an activation function (unit step function in this case) to get the final prediction.

## Part 3: Neural Network

This part involved implementing a 2 layer neural network with biases. The network could classify penguins into three classes given their bill length, bill depth, flipper length, and body mass.
A neural network works similarly to a perceptron, except it utilises a gradient descent function to essentially learn from its incorrect predictions and improve it's accuracy.
