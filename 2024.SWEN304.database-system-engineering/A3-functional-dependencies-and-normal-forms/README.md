# A3: Functional Dependencies and Normal Forms

This assignment involved:
- Determining what normal form a given relation schema satisfies
- Functional dependency inference
- Calculating the minimal cover of a set of functional dependencies
- Normalizing a relation schema into 3NF using a lossless transformation using the Synthesis algorithm
- Normalizing a relation schema into BCNF using a lossless transformation using the decomposition algorithm
