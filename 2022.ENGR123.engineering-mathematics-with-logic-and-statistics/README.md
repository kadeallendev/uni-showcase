# ENGR123 Engineering Mathematics with Logic and Statistics

This course teaches mathematical techniques employed by cybersecurity and software engineers, including methods of combinatorics, logic, probability, and decision theory. On the logic combinatorics side, we will study propositional logic, introductory graph theory, proofs, sets and relations, and induction and recursion. On the probability and statistics side, we will study data and sampling, probabilities and random variables, estimation and confidence intervals, and model fitting.

## Course Learning Objectives

1. Know the important definitions and results in introductory logics and statistics.
2. Understand their significance to computer science and dealing with data.
3. Demonstrate your understanding by stating definitions and results, and solving simple problems.
